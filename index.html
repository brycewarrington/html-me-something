                <p>I had one of the best trips of my life recently. Two close friends and I took a road trip to New Orleans before it is engulfed by the sea due to global warming. 
                    We went to visit our lovely friend Daphne for Halloweekend and overdose on biegnets. The city is weird, the people are weird, so I felt right at home. 
                    Yes, they know how to party in NOLA, but open container laws are seriously underrated. Come with me down to the Big Easy!</p>

                    <h2 id="food">Food</h2>
                    <p>I went on this trip as a vegetarian, continued as a pescatarian, and left with a new rule: When on vacation, try to beat your meat consumption personal record. 
                        The food is to die for and is worth all of the hype. Cuisine highlight was the sweet, heavenly ambrosia in the form of shrimp and grits we had from Melbas. 
                        Fun fact: Melbas is open 24 hours and is connected to a laundromat.</p>

                    <p>Among the dozens of things that makes Nawlins special is the funky painted houses. I always imagined a world where city housing regulations cant tell people 
                        that pink houses arenâ€™t cool. Look at this pink house. Tell me it isnt cool!</p>

                    <h2 id="bourbon">Bourbon Street</h2>
                    <p>Although basic, Bourbon Street was pretty fun. The sound of brass filled the air and so did the smell of urine. 
                        We had to get trashy hand grenades for the occasion.</p>

                    <p>Personally I feel a city is as great as its public bathrooms and art museums. NO did not disappoint. 
                        We visited the New Orleans museum of Art (NOMA) and the Ogden  Museum of Southern Art. My highlight was seeing this country Lana Del Rey painting at the Ogden.</p>

                    <h2 id="park">Audubon Park</h2>
                    <p>Somewhat equivalent to STLs Forest Park, Audabon Park is a huge city park with sights and endless selfie opportunity. 
                        We visited the huge Tree of Life and watched local drunks (college students) on the riverfront at The Fly.</p>

                    <p>My friends and I take Halloween very seriously. So seriously, that I came up with two last minute costumes that made me appear a lot cooler than I actually am. 
                        Check out mini Michael Jackson and Jean Michel Basquiat.</p>

                    <h2 id="voodoo">Voodoo Fest</h2>
                    <p>We went to the amazing music festival Voodoo fest. We were blessed to see legends LCD Soundsystem and Kendrick Lamar. I lost my wallet. 
                        I took terrible videos. Im pretty sure a witch tried to steal my soul. </p>

                    <h2 id="magazine">Magazine Street</h2>
                    <p>Our last night out we visited Frenchman street, where I dont remember having an alligator hotdog. It was a literal parade going on. 
                        We danced in the streets. Eventually we ended up at a cool party at Hi-Ho Lounge. They played two of my favorite artists Kaytranada and Azealia Banks. 
                        I danced on top of every stable (and some unstable I discovered) surface in the club.</p>

                    <h2 id="close">Reflection</h2>
                    <p>This city is amazing and not as shallow as you'd think. Or maybe my friends are amzing and not shallow. Either way, I seriously cried from happiness having such a beautiful trip.
                        Travel more, it is good for your soul. Check out more of my terrible photos <a href src="">header</a>.
